# stock-market-analysis-and-pediction
use pandas to get stock information, visualize different aspects of it, and finally we will look at a few ways of analyzing the risk of a stock, based on its previous performance history. We will also be predicting future stock prices through a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) method!

The following questions will be answered:

1.) What was the change in price of the stock over time?
2.) What was the daily return of the stock on average?
3.) What was the moving average of the various stocks?
4.) What was the correlation between different stocks'?
5.) How much value do we put at risk by investing in a particular stock?
6.) How can we attempt to predict future stock behavior? (Predicting the closing price stock price of APPLE inc using LSTM)
